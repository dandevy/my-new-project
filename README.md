# Promising AI tool can detect lung cancer at an early stage, even before doctors can see it

Final project for the Building AI course




## Summary
Artificial intelligence can discover early indications of the disease before doctors can see it on a CT scan?The naked eye cannot see everything, so this AI tool can detect it quicker than the naked eye can see.The new AI tool called Sybil has been developed by scientists from the Mass General Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge US.







## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
It is possible to detect lungcancer earlier;lungcancer is the thirth form of cancer in Belgium (see the illustration)My personal motivation is that I am a family doctor and I have patients who have lungcancer and also my father died from lungcancer at the eye of 48.
This topic is very important because it is still difficult to detect lungcancer  at an early stage.

## How is it used?

In the Netherlands 2 students from school have developed an AI project to early detect lungcancer by training the AI with 25000 pictures of lungcancer in different stadia and worked together with a pneumologist of a Dutch Hospital
The solution will be used by radiologists and pneumologists via CTSCAN

## Challenges
The project will nog solve lungcancer, because given the fact that it will be recognised a little earlier, there is still CT scan needed and first of all the patient will have symptoms, because CT scan is no good for screening a whole population






## What next?
There should be developed another method to detect lungcancer that can be used for population screening
